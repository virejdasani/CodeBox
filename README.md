- CodeBox is a coding environment with HTML, CSS and JavaScript editors with a live preview panel to show what the code would look like in the browser
- It's made using the Electron framework
- It is inspired by Codepen and JsFiddle
## Why use CodeBox?
- CodeBox is better than the editors in CodePen and JSFiddle because CodeBox features the same editor used in VS Code.
- This means that it has autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and a lot of other features that we all know and love from VS Code
- Furthermore, it features hot reload which means, you don't have to press Ctrl/Cmd + S to show the code in the preview panel. It reloads automatically every time any key is pressed!
